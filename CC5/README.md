Holy moly. I absolutely mean this when I say I could not have done this without 
the helprooms and office hours I spent all my time writing this in. Professor Onsay 
and all of the TAs were a huge help. This coding challenge is quite honestly the most 
confusing thing I have ever written (Who knows what that says about my coding experience).
I always try to implement things on paper before writing any code. I never got to that point
with this coding challenge. I eventually resulted to piecing together fragments from various
piazza posts and recommendations from TAs. I started from scratch a couple times as well.
The combination of a recursive call stack and returning a tuple makes it very hard to follow. 
Truly a challenge. 
# Time to Completion
10 hours? It is hard to say. Majority of that was probably me just banging my head
against my desk lol.
